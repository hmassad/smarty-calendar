# React Calendar

run with `yarn start`
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## ðŸš¨ Pending

- wrong calculation of time in events, it calculates 4 when it must be 5, must review
- edit/confirm event popup
- look and feel of events (creating, dragging, open popup, normal)
- do not allow overlapping of events when dragging

## âœ¨ Nice to have

- single day view, three day view
- multiline ellipsis for all day events
- use colors from events
- allow 30 min slots for time of day
- add exclusion zones, like working hours

## ðŸš€ Improvement Opportunities

- 4 initial renders, should be 2
- double render on every time update

## âœ” Done

- this week view
- adjust to 10 min intervals on drag
- drag change start or end
- drag move
- allow event deletion
- variable pixel height
- prevent render of unaffected components on mouse move
