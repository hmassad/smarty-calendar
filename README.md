# React Calendar

run with `yarn start`
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Pending

- prevent render of unaffected components on mouse move
- adjust to 5 min intervals on drag
- drag change event
- edit event popup
- confirm event popup
- padding and margin on events

## Nice to have

- this week view (implemented), single day view, three day view
- multiline ellipsis for all day events
- use colors from events
- allow 30 min slots for time of day
- add exclusion zones, like working hours

## Improvement Opportunities

- 4 initial renders, should be 2
- double render on every time update
