# React Calendar

the first time, run `yarn install`

run with `yarn start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## ðŸš¨ Pending

- edit/confirm event popup
- look and feel of events (creating, dragging, open popup, normal)
- when minHour and maxHour are not default, dragging doesn't work

## âœ¨ Nice to have

- mouse move: shadow with default duration when a user is not dragging but moving the mouse over the calendar
- support events spanning more than one day, drawing and drag moving
- single day view, three day view
- multiline ellipsis for all day events
- use colors from events
- vertical slots of 30 minutes
- add exclusion zones, like working hours

## ðŸš€ Improvement Opportunities

- 4 initial renders, should be 2
- double render on every time update

## âœ… Done

- this week view
- adjust to 10 min intervals on drag
- drag change start or end
- drag move
- allow event deletion
- variable pixel height
- prevent render of unaffected components on mouse move
- wrong calculation of time in events, it calculates 4 when it must be 5, must review
- minimum event duration
- do not allow overlapping of events while dragging
- drag events from one day to the other
